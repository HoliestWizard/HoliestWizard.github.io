        <center><h1>Landslides, What Are They?</h1></center>
        A landslide is an encompassing term for a “mass wasting” event. These events are any  down-slope movement of soil or rock under the influence of gravity. There are 5 major modes of movements for landslides: falls, topples, slides, spreads, and flows (U.S. Geological Survey, 2024a).
        <br>
        <br>
        Landslides occur when the material the earth is made out of is to weak to withstand the forces against it. Landslides can be triggered by forces that would further weaken the ground such as: rainfall, snowmelt, changes in water level, stream erosion, ground water (basically anything to do with water), earthquakes, volcanism, and human activity (U.S. Geological Survey, 2024a).

        <center><h1>Geographic Elements of Landslides</h1></center>
        FEMA lists a few elements of the environment that can increase the likelihood of landslide: areas where wildfires or humans have destroyed vegetation,  adjacent to steep slopes, in areas previously hit by landslides, on or at the base of steep slopes, and many many more. (2024)
        <br>
        <br>
        Also unfortunate: for us Utahns, the rocky mountains are one of the worst areas to be in: “Although all 50 states are subject to landslide activity, the Rocky Mountain, Appalachian, and Pacific Coast regions generally suffer the greatest landslide losses.”
        (FEMA, 2024)

    <section class="slide" id="slide-3">
        <center><h1>Impacts of Landslides</h1></center>
        Some of the impacts listed by the World Health Care Organization are broken infrastructure,  waterborne diseases, electrocution or laceration from falling debris, as well as mental health issues due to the loss of livestock, property or family. (n.d.)
        <br>
        <br>
        Adding to this, a few more side effects include contaminated water and/or food, blocked road ways (preventing fast emergency response), and the loss of livelihoods and jobs (European Climate And Health Observatory, 2024 a).

    <section class="slide" id="slide-4">
        <center><h1>Mitigation and Preparation</h1></center>
        While the ultimate strategy to avoid landslides is not to live near mountains or steep hills, in Utah, that is especially not feasible from Herriman to Magna, being that the cities are either on, or around the mountain, so preparation is the ultimate goal.
        <br>
        <br>
        Many deaths occur during sleep on the lower floors, to remedy this: “Stay alert and awake during a storm that could cause a landslide. Many deaths from landslides occur while people are sleeping”(United States, n.d.).
        <br>
        <br>
        Ready.gov recommends a few strategies to prepare: Have a plan and be aware of warning systems such as the EAS, find the nearest shelter for your area if you feel unsafe (Text SHELTER + your ZIP code to 43362 (4FEMA) to find the nearest shelter), and build an emergency kit just in case: you should include things such as water, food, medical supplies, maps, a flashlight, a dust mask, and a whistle (in case of needing rescue) (United States, n.d.).

        <center><h1>The Plan</h1></center>

        Now with the groundwork laid out and the maps shown, it is important to know what to do for your neighborhood.
        As discussed earlier, you should personalize your plan and be ready (if you do live in a susceptible area).

        <br>
        <br>

        If your area is in an escepcially susecptible area, finding the nearest shelter may be the best option
        (Text SHELTER + your ZIP code to 43362 (4FEMA) to find the nearest shelter) is of vital importance.
        (Do consider alternative shelters as FEMA doens't have shelters in every state)

        <br>
        <br>

        If you need to evacuate, bring a safety kit and all living things on your property.
        If you don't need to evacuate, make sure your property is ready for the landslide before it occurs,
        and have a radio ready to listen for updates. <strong>Stay away from the landslide at all costs</strong>

        <br>
        <br>

        Again, the best option you have is to be away from any potential landslides and be prepared
        for one before they strike!

        <br>
