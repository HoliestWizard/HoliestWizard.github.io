        <li>
            3:14 : Mini meteor pebbles/chunks shred through guy, satelite, and space shuttle; explosions occur
            because micheal bay has a twisted explosive view of reality
        </li>
        <li>
            5:30 : Nothing is known about what happened to the shuttle, defcon 3 declared, military has been put into
            action/on watch just in case
        </li>
        <li>
            7:00 : small meteorite hit a building, seemed to be basketball sized, caused small explosion: flipped 1
            car and knocked over a streetlight
        </li>
        <li>
            8:00 : meteorite storm hits the streets, caused minor explosions (I think these would destroy city blocks
            rather than just single cars/streetlamps)
        </li>
        <li>
            8:20 : it turns out the meteorites are about 1-8x the size of a human depending on scene

        <li>
            11:30 : meteorite declared "global killer" -- nothing would survive the impact
        </li>
        <li>
            24:12 : pacific impact = 3 mile high tidal wave that travels 1000+ mph (from california to denver)
            half of the worlds population will be incenerated, the other will die of the cold from the nuclear winter
        </li>
        <li>
            24:44 : meteor moving at 22k mph
        </li>
        <li>
            45:29 : the goal is to split the meteor into 2 parts, the explosion is hoping to
            move the path of the resulting debris past the earth on both sides, basically going
            from "straight towards earth" to "looking like a greater than sign (>)",

            for the bomb is what I am assuming)
        </li>
        <li>
            57:20 : meteor hits south asia in water, it destroys town, its about 4-8x the size
            of a human.
        </li>
        <li>
            58:22 : From the last bullet point -- 50,000 people in shanghai died, estimated tidal wave of either
            500 or 5000 feet, likely the former (audio cut off)
        </li>
        <li>
            1:59:52 : the paris meteor is likely anywhere from 0.5 to just under 2x the size
            of the eiffel tower, the impact seems plausible as it shows the
            city being destroyed, but I am would imagine that the meteor would more damage than
            that

    In Armagedon, Harry Stamper is tasked with drilling a hole in the astroid heading towards earth.
    The United States Government and NASA divise a plan to insert a nuclear warhead into the hole
    that Harry will drill. Harry selects his team of objectively unqualified people, but the show
    must go on as they are the best drill team earth has. The meteor is the size of Texas and will
    destroy the earth and make mankind go extinct, so it is vital to get the job done before it
    is too late.

<div id="science">
    Generally, many believe that Armageddon was awful in terms of science. Even within the first opening
    scene the absolute power of an astroid impact was down-played: "It is correctly pointed out that an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. But the explosive power is stated as a miserly 10,000 atomic bombs. This is wrong. That asteroid created a blast of 100,000,000 atomic bombs! The figure is off by four zeroes"
    (Jupiter Science, 1998).

    The idea that a singular nuclear warhead could split a Texas-sized astroid is downright "stupid" in intellectual terms.
    An astrophysicist -- Kirsten Howley -- adds their input:

    <div class="block-quote">
        So, we're talking about something that's an 800-mile-in-diameter object that's going to hit Earth in one hour. The amount of energy it would take to push two equal-sized pieces in opposite directions such that they miss Earth [like in “Armageddon”] is equivalent to about the total energy output of the sun in a day,” Howley says. “And we do not have that capability
        (Schelenz, 2021)
    </div>

    <br>
</div>

<div>
    So far the movie is objectively incorrect, but I must admit, it is sometimes fun to turn off the science-brain and enjoy
    movies at face value. There were many funny moments that I loved, but again, I must admit, the scienece was off by a long shot.
    Another major issue that the movie had was that no one saw an astroid the size of Texas until 18 days before impact:
    “You would probably be able to see it with the naked eye at least a few months before it hit. In Armageddon, they don’t notice it until 18 days before the rock smashes into us.",
    says Alastair Bruce -- an Edinburgh University PhD student (Monks, 2020). I am no astrophysicist, but I can safely assume
    that if texas was flying towards earth at 22k mph, I would see it earlier than 18 days before impact.
</div>

<br>
<br>

<div>

    Another issue (they keep piling up) is that the bomb itself would have to be so powerful not only would it have
    to produce as much energy as the sun, it would also turn the meteor into a radioactive one, said astronomer Phil Plait (Lewis, 2014).
    Picture a bomb with the power of the sun detonating above the earth's atmosphere: we'd be toast and in no better position than
    when the astroid was the problem.

</div>
<br>
<br>
<div>

    Lastly, the main issue I personally noticed is that simply detonating a bomb in the astroid wouldn't help
    the problem: instead of 1 large astroid, it would be split into a shower of meteorites resembling
    hellfire.
    "Even if you were able to vaporise the entire rock, it would still be moving with an incredible speed towards the earth... All you’ve really done is spread out the impact.”
    (Monks, 2020)
    So If we manage to survive the nuclear explosion above the atmosphere, we now have to avoid being struck down by particles that would
    be spread out rather than centeralized in 1 texas-sized meteor.

<div id="summary">

    The meteor was the main driving force of the plot, being that they destroyed it or everyone -- and largely everything -- on earth dies.
    But in terms of scienece, this movie was bottom of the barrel. Many of the small meteorites would have destroyed a much larger area:
    many basketball sized meteors did nothing but flip a car and destroy a streetlamp. The larger meteorites (which I suspect are
    around 4-8 people tall) would have destroyed city blocks. The imagery of Paris being destroyed is among the only imagery that
    looked accurate in terms of meteorite collisions with earth.
